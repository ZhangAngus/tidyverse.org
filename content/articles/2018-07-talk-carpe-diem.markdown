Summer conference season is in full swing, with [useR! 2018 in Brisbane](https://user2018.r-project.org) coming up next week!

Conference talks are a great opportunity to help people learn about the cool and useful things you have built. A few concrete practices will make your marketing efforts more effective.

*We assume your product meets your quality standards and that you have already documented it. This is about stuff you can do in ~1 hour as you prepare you talk that will have high payoff in terms of recruiting users. This is also not about how to give a great talk.*

## Marketing is not a Four Letter Word

First, let's deal with the word and concept of "marketing".

> Marketing is the study and management of exchange relationships.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing

If you have taken the trouble to build an R package, Shiny app, tutorial, or talk, presumably you would like people to know about it and use it! Marketing is the set of activities that help your target audience

  * discover that your thing exists
  * learn how your thing could benefit them

Use your talk (and documentation and README, etc.) to accomplish these goals!

Some creators take a peculiar pride in being "bad at marketing", but it is not some elusive skill. Nor is marketing ability anti-correlated with creating a high-quality product. You can acknowledge the value in marketing or you can declare that cultivating broader usage is not your goal. Pick one.

## Where does your thing live?

Determine the primary online home for your product. Possibilities:

  * A custom website, possibly made with [pkgdown](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org), [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), or, in the case of [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com), a [running instance of the app itself](https://www.shinyapps.io)
  * A development venue, such as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com)
  * A [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html) package landing page

Visit this home with the eyes of a newcomer and refine accordingly. If your thing has multiple online homes, make sure they link to each other, with a strong current towards the primary home.

## Make a shortlink

Unless your primary URL is already extremely short and memorable, consider creating a shortlink that is both. A link in a talk will be captured in cell phone photos and typed with fingers into phones. Make it easy on people!

## Title and closing slide

Make a slide with the most important details on you and your thing. Include this very early in your talk (probably first?) and repeat some variant at the end. This slide should feature your shortlink and any relevant URLs or handles, e.g. Twitter, GitHub, website, or email address.

DO THIS IN AN ABSOLUTELY HUGE FONT. Now is not the time for subtlety or mumbling "I know it's hard to read, but ...".

Leave this slide up for a bigly amount of time, so that people have ample opportunity to get out their phones and fire up the camera. Do not flash this vital slide for 3 seconds, only to spend 2 minutes displaying a bulleted outline of your talk.

## Feature slides

Admit that people photograph and share individual slides, e.g., via Twitter. This can be a good thing, especially if you harness it for your goals! If an audience member is moved to share your thing, it is natural they want to enhance the basic message with an evocative slide or image. Think about how well your slides work with this well-established behaviour.

If something would be terrible taken out of context or circulated widely, reflect on that and take appropriate measures.

If you have a pithy and hilarious point, give that slide some extra attention.

*Link to some guides on live-tweeting? If you'd be chuffed to see people tweet about your talk, view your talk through their eyes. This is like grant-writing: notice the words the funder uses to describe what they want to fund and repeat them back, verbatim. Find out what a live-tweeter needs and give them exactly that.*

## Post it before the talk

Choose your primary online home and secure a shortlink at it BEFORE YOUR TALK. Do not promise the slides or materials "after the talk". People are taking notes and photos right now, during your talk, and this is your best chance to tell them how to find your awesome thing when they get home.

Even if you add more materials or update your slides after the talk, it is still worth it to publicize the shortlink during the talk. These tweets will live on for months and wrap-up blog posts will come out over the next couple of weeks. Most of the genuine visits to your thing will happen later, but you will never have such a comparable opportunity to put the URL in front of people's eyeballs.

## Share slides on a slide-sharing platform

Consider how easy it is for a wide audience to click through your slides with minimum friction. Slide-specific platforms, such as [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com), are ideal for quick browsing and linking to specific slides.

The way you interact with and present your slides is not necessarily a great distribution platform. Large PDFs in GitHub repo do not offer a pleasant browsing experience and raw HTML slides on GitHub are even worse, i.e. are not viewable.
